# Purple Hyacinth Bot

Welcome! I have coded a Purple Hyacinth bot dedicated to the webtoon [Purple Hyacinth](https://www.webtoons.com/en/mystery/purple-hyacinth/list?title_no=1621)!

I opened this repository so that if I ever have to move computers (which happens frequently, since I don't have my own laptop yet), I have a backup copy of the code. :D

You can look at it for how I tackled the code for specific commands ig? *shrugs*
